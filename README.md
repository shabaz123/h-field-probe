# H-Field Probe

## Contents

h-field-probe-changpuak-gerbers-v1.zip : This file contains files recreated from https://www.changpuak.ch/electronics/MagneticFieldProbe.php (the original files appeared to be missing drill hole dimensions, so I've used 0.4 mm holes for the via fences, and 0.8 mm hole for the via that produces the short for the loop.

The PCB is 2-layer, and must be the standard thickness (i.e. approx. 1.6 mm). 

Note: I did not create this design. This repo merely contains the regenerated files for convenience.
